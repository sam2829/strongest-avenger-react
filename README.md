# Strongest Avenger React

## Overview

Stongest Avenger React is designed so that the user is able to post images or videos of the favourite Marvel character or others being their favourite character and argue that they are the strongest. The User is able to view a list or posts from all other users. The user can register or login to their own account and be available then to make their own posts, comment on other posts, agree, follow other users, like other posts, update their own profile to tell abit about themselves and their favourite character.

## Project Goals

This is my fifth portfolio project for the Code Institute and the goal with this project is to display my new skills in using frameworks such as React (for the frontend) and Django Rest Framework. I have decided to build a social media website where users are able to create accounts and make posts or their favourite Marvel characters or them being their favourite Marvel characters. The User can also, comment, like, agree on other posts and being able to follow other users to see their posts.

This repository is for the React front end of Strongest Avenger. The project also utilises a Django Rest Framework API, which you can find the link to that repository [here](https://github.com/sam2829/strongest-avenger-drf)
