## Project Goals

This is my fifth portfolio project for the Code Institute and the goal with this project is to display my new skills in using frameworks such as React (for the frontend) and Django Rest Framework. I have decided to build a social media website where users are able to create accounts and make posts or their favourite Marvel characters or them being their favourite Marvel characters. The User can also, comment, like, agree on other posts and being able to follow other users to see their posts.

This repository is for the React front end of Strongest Avenger. The project also utilises a Django Rest Framework API, which you can find the link to that repository [here](https://github.com/sam2829/strongest-avenger-drf)
